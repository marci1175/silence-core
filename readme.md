### A crate to make voip services easier to create.
Silence-core provides core functions, helpers and type definitions for a voip service to work.
If you just want a quick and easy way to set up a voip service, you should use [silence](https://crates.io/crates/silence) instead as it provides a more complete (end-user friendly) approach.
